      <h1>IOS 13: HOW TO TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR IMESSAGE PROFILE</h1>
      <p>Beginning with iOS 13, you can automatically beam your preferred name and photo (or Memoji) to other iOS users when they chat with you in the Messages app—although they can choose whether to use them or not. Not only does this option let your friends and contacts see you as you want them to see you, but it also eradicates some of the more tedious steps of adding new people to your Contacts app.Here’s how to do it.</p>
      <img class="slikeBlog" src="Slike/how-to-set-a-custom-profile-for-imessage-100809290-large.jpg" alt="ios13">
      <h2>How to set a custom name and photo through the Messages app</h2>
      <p>You can set this up straight through the Messages app, which is super convenient when you want to swap photos on the fly. You’ll have to do a little extra leg work for the first-time setup (which is what we’re focusing on here), but it’ll get a lot simpler afterward.</p>
      <p>Here’s where you’ll have a few options. At the top, you’ll see big, circular icons for the different options, and you can scroll them from the right in order to see more. If you’ve already made a Memoji or set your own photo in the Contacts app, you’ll see those options first, followed by an option to simply use your initials. If you see something you like, press Continue. Once you’ve scrolled through all of these icons, you’ll see that one of the circles says “View More,” and you can use that to set Memoji (and Animoji), photos, and name slots all from the same interface. We’ve provided detailed walkthroughs for Memoji and Photos in the following two sections.</p>
      <p>At this point, press Contacts Only if you only want to share this information with your mutual contacts. iOS will automatically send the name and photo to the contact the next time your message them.
        
        Press Always Ask if you want iOS to ask you if it should send your updated name and photo to a contact. If you select this, the next time you send a message to a person after you’ve changed your information, you’ll see a menu at the top of the chat thread reading “Share your name and photo?”—along with a preview of your name and photo. Press the small Share prompt and iOS will immediately send them your information.</p>

      <p>How to use a Memoji or Animoji with your iMessage profile
        If the thought of using a photo sounds too dull, iOS lets you use a Memoji or an Animoji for your profile instead. Note: You’ll need an iPhone with TrueDepth sensors (such as the iPhone X, XS, or 11 Pro). Already set up a Memoji through the normal process? You’re good to go, and you’ll see it during Step 3 as I described it above.
        
        With iOS 13, though, you can also make a Memoji through the new profile interface. Here’s how. The following walkthrough assumes you’ve already set a profile with a photo above, as the steps are slightly different for return visits.</p>
      <h2>How to use a photo for your iMessage profile</h2>
      <p>It’s super easy to use and swap out photos for your profile. Here’s how.
        
        Open Messages.
        Press the three dots in the upper right for more options.
        Press Edit Name and Photos.
        Press the Edit button under the circular image icon at the top.
        If you want to use an existing photo, press All Photos to the right side of the Suggestions heading in the new interface that pops up. You can choose your photos from there. If you want to take a new selfie, press the camera icon under Suggestions and you can take one. You can apply one of nine filters to each. Press Done in the upper right.
        You’ll see a prompt asking “Use This Photo Everywhere?” Press Use.
        And you’re done!</p>
      <h2>How to turn off (and edit) name and photo sharing</h2>
      <img class="slikeBlog" alt="sas" src="Slike/how-to-add-a-custom-imessage-profile-2-100809285-large.jpg">
      <p>f you decide you no longer want iOS to send your name and photo to your contacts, it’s easy to turn off the feature.
        
        Open the Messages app.
        Press the three dots in the upper right for more options.
        Press Edit Name and Photo.
        Your existing profile will pop up. Toward the middle, you’ll see a toggle to turn off Name and Photo Sharing. If it’s green, switch it off. That’s all!
        You can also use this memo to change your preferences as to whether you want to send changes to all your contacts or the Messages app should always ask for approval.</p>
      <h2>How to set your profile through the Settings app</h2>
      <p>Prefer the “long way”? You can also set up your custom name and photo through the Settings app. Open the Settings app, press Messages, and then press Share Name and Photo around halfway through the interface. You’ll see a profile screen where you can change your photo, your name, and set your preferences.

      <h1>HOW TO SET UP A VPN IN WINDOWS</h1>
      <img class="slikeBlog" alt="vcv" src="Slike/secured-vpn-tunnel-100749163-large.jpg">
      <p>VPN (virtual private network) technology lets a computer using a public internet connection join a private network by way of a secure “tunnel” between that machine and the network. This protects the data from being seen or tampered with by bad actors. The two most common use cases are consumer VPN services that allow individuals to surf privately from home or a public setting, and business-oriented solutions that allow employees to securely connect to a corporate network remotely.</p>
      <p>For the most part, VPN connections are handled by custom software such as the many consumer VPN services we’ve reviewed, or by third-party generic software such as the OpenVPN client or Cisco AnyConnect. Another option that’s generally supported by most virtual private networks is to use Microsoft’s built-in VPN client. This is useful when some VPNs don’t provide their own client or if you want to use a VPN protocol not supported by your VPN’s client such as IKEv2. 
        
        The downside to using the built-in client is that you have to select a specific server to use as opposed to jumping between different locations the way you can with a commercial VPN service. On the other hand, most employer-supplied VPNs will offer a limited number of servers you can connect to, which makes using this client ideal.</p>

      <h2>Step by step: How to set up a VPN in Windows 10</h2>
      <p>Step 1 Click on the Cortana search bar or button on the taskbar and type vpn.<br>
        <br>
        Step 2 The top choice should be Change virtual private networks (VPN). Alternatively, open the Settings app and go to Network and Internet - VPN. Step 3 At the top of the VPN screen in the Settings app, click Add a VPN connection. Step 4 In the screen that appears, enter the details for your VPN connection. Under “VPN provider” click on the drop-down menu, and select Windows (built-in). This will also change “VPN type” to Automatic, and “Type of sign-in info” to User name and password.<br>
        Step 5 Next fill out the “Connection name” and “Server name or address.” These vary based on your VPN provider—whether a third-party service or an employer. For this example, we’re using Acevpn, a clientless VPN service that supports various connection types such as IKEv2, L2TP, and PPTP.<br>
        <br>
        Step 6 Scroll down this screen and you’ll see a spot to enter your username and password for the VPN—again provided by your VPN service. Once the information is entered, click Save, and close the Settings app. Step 7 Click the Wi-Fi icon in the system tray on your taskbar, and select your newly created VPN connection, which should be right at the top of the list. It should automatically start to connect, and if all goes well the connection process should happen relatively quickly.<br>
        <img class="slikeBlog" alt="vcv" src="Slike/addavpnconnection2-100749624-large.jpg"> <br>
        The above process works for the easier VPN connection types such as PPTP and L2TP, but if you want to use IKEv2 that requires installing a root certificate from your VPN provider. Keep in mind that not every service supports IKEv2 so using this method depends greatly on your VPN service provider or employer.
        
        Regardless, here’s how it works on Windows 10.
        
        First, download your VPN provider’s IKEv2 certificate to your desktop or somewhere else that’s convenient. Next, double-click on the certificate file and a security warning pops-up. Click Open.
        
        On the next window that opens click Install certificate... Now we’ve arrived at the Certificate Import Wizard. Select the Local Machine radio button and click Next.
        
        On the next screen make sure to select the radio button labeled Place all certificates in the following store, and click Browse...
        
        A smaller window opens with a folder tree. Select Trusted Root Certification Authorities and then click OK. Now we’re back at the Certificate Import Wizard window. From here click Next.
        
        The hard part is over. On the next screen click Finish and then OK in the smaller window. <br>
        Now that the certificate is installed we can set up the IKEv2 VPN using the same step-by-step instructions above. Just make sure that you select IKEv2 under “VPN type,” and then use the server name, address, and username and password provided by your service provider.
        
        Once you’ve connected to the VPN, check to see that your VPN is working by visiting IPleak.net. You should see an IP address, and DNS servers that are different from your non-VPN state. If you don’t, there are a number of potential causes that we can’t go into here. Your best bet is to check with your company’s IP department or the support service of your VPN.<br>
        <br>
        However, one easy and common fix for IKEv2 problems is to right-click on your Wi-Fi or ethernet icon in the system tray, and select Open Network and Sharing Center from the context menu.  When the Control Panel opens click Change adapter settings on the left side, then right-click the name of your VPN connection and go to Properties - Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) - Properties - Advanced... - IP Settings. Check “Use default gateway on remote network” and click OK. Close up all the windows and try IP Leak again.</p>
